# CryptoMiner Pro

## Project Overview
CryptoMiner Pro is an advanced blockchain mining simulation application that allows users to simulate the mining of cryptocurrency. It provides real-time statistics about the blockchain like total blocks, hash rate, difficulty, and rewards, along with a simple interface to control the mining process and an explorer to view the blockchain.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/crypto-miner-pro.git
   cd crypto-miner-pro
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   You need to have `Node.js` and `npm` installed. After cloning the repository, install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the CSS using PostCSS:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:css
   ```

4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is up and running, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

- To start mining, click the **Start Mining** button.
- To stop the mining process, click the **Stop Mining** button.
- The current mining progress will be displayed, along with various statistics.

## Features
- Real-time cryptocurrency mining simulation
- Display of blockchain statistics (total blocks, hash rate, difficulty, last reward)
- Simple control panel for starting/stopping mining and resetting the blockchain
- Blockchain Explorer to view details of mined blocks
- Responsive design with a modern interface
